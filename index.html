        <div class="box"><p>
            Pursued a rigorous academic program focused on the design, development, and implementation of embedded systems, in other words the unified engineering of both hardware and software. It deals with real-time systems, and device drivers. Acquired a comprehensive understanding of microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and operating systems. Gained hands-on experience in utilizing tools like Keil, MATLAB, and Simulink for system simulation and analysis. Gained proficiency in industry-standard tools and methodologies. Developed a strong foundation in embedded systems, honing skills in: 
            <ul>
                <li>Microcontroller programming (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)</li>
                <li>Real-time operating systems (RTOS)</li>
                <li>Sensor interfacing and data acquisition</li>
                <li>Wireless communication protocols (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)</li>
            </ul>
            I carried out two mini-projects successfully: a telecom tower management system based on Arduino and an intrusion detection camera system based on raspberry pi. My final thesis work was on cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communications.
