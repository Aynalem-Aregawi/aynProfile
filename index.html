            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <h3>Master of Engineering in Embedded Systems, Jain University, Bangalore, India | 2019-2021</h3><p>
            Pursued a rigorous academic program focused on the design, development, and implementation of embedded systems, in other words the unified engineering of both hardware and software. It deals with real-time systems, and device drivers. Acquired a comprehensive understanding of microcontrollers, digital signal processors, and operating systems. Gained hands-on experience in utilizing tools like Keil, MATLAB, and Simulink for system simulation and analysis. Gained proficiency in industry-standard tools and methodologies. Developed a strong foundation in embedded systems, honing skills in: 
            Microcontroller programming (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
            Real-time operating systems (RTOS)
            Sensor interfacing and data acquisition
            Wireless communication protocols (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)
            I carried out two mini-projects successfully: a telecom tower management system based on Arduino and an intrusion detection camera system based on raspberry pi. My final thesis work was on cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communications.</p>
            <br> </br>

            <h3>Bacheleor of Science in Electrical Engineering, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia</h3><p>
            In a 5 years long 186 credit hours of Engineering program, I successfully completed my B.Sc. degree course which consisted of both electrical and electronics course at Addis Ababa University. The university is the oldest and the best university in Ethiopia.
